# Ansible Network Acls

[![CI](https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.acls/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.acls/actions/workflows/tests.yml)[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/7660/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/7660)

This repository contains the `network.acls` Ansible Collection.

## About

- Ansible Network Acls Collection contains the role that provides a platform-agnostic way of
  managing acls resources. This collection provides the user the capabilities to gather,
  deploy, remediate, configure and perform health checks for network acls resources.

- Network Acls collection can be used by anyone who is looking to manage and maintain acls resources. This includes system administrators and IT professionals.

## Requirements

- [Requires Ansible](https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.base/blob/main/meta/runtime.yml)
- [Requires Content Collections](https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.base/blob/main/galaxy.yml#L5https://forum.ansible.com/c/news/5/none)
- [Testing Requirements](https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.base/blob/main/test-requirements.txt)
- Users also need to include platform collections as per their requirements. The supported platform collections are:
  - [arista.eos](https://github.com/ansible-collections/arista.eos)
  - [cisco.ios](https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.ios)
  - [cisco.iosxr](https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.iosxr)
  - [cisco.nxos](https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.nxos)
  - [junipernetworks.junos](https://github.com/ansible-collections/junipernetworks.junos)

## Installation
To consume this Validated Content from Automation Hub, the following needs to be added to ansible.cfg:
```
[galaxy]
server_list = automation_hub

[galaxy_server.automation_hub]
url=https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/content/published/
auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
token=<SuperSecretToken>
```

Get the required token from the [Automation Hub Web UI](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token).

With this configured, simply run the following commands:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install network.base
ansible-galaxy collection install network.acls
```

## Use Cases

- `Build Brownfield Inventory`: This enables users to fetch the YAML structured resource module facts for acls resources like acls and acls_interfaces and save them as host_vars to a local or remote data store which could be used as a single SOT for other operations.
- `Acls Resource Management`: Users want to be able to manage the acls and acl_interfaces configurations.
  This also includes the enablement of gathering facts, updating acls resource host-vars, and deploying config onto the appliance.
- `Acls Health Checks`: Users want to be able to perform health checks for acls applications. These health checks should be able to provide the acls configuration status with the necessary details.
- Detect Drift and remediate: This enables users to detect any drift between the provided config and running-config and if required then override the running config.

This platform-agnostic role enables the user to perform acls health checks. Users can perform the following health checks:
       `available_acls`
       `details`
       `missing_acls`
       `unassigned_acls`
- This role enables users to create a runtime brownfield inventory with all the acls configurations regarding host vars. These host vars are ansible facts gathered through the *_acls and *_acl_interfaces network resource modules. The tasks offered by this role can be observed below:

### Perform acls Health Checks
- Health Checks operation fetches the current status of acls configuration health.
- This can also include the details about the acls available, missing (not configured), and unassigned acls.

```yaml
health_checks.yml
---
- name: Perform health checks
  hosts: rtr1
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Acls Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.acls.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.ios.ios
      operations:
        - name: health_check
```


### Building Brownfield Inventory with Persist
- Persist operation fetches the acls and acls_interfaces facts and stores them as host vars.
The result of a successful Persist operation would be host_vars having YAML formatted resource facts.
- These host_vars could exist locally or even be published to a remote repository acting as SOT for operations like deploy, remediate, detect, etc.

#### - fetch acls resource facts and build local data_store.
```yaml
- name: Persist the facts into host vars
  hosts: rtr1
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Network acls Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.acls.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.ios.ios
      operations:
        - name: persist
      data_store:
        local: "~/backup/network"
```

#### - fetch acls resource facts and publish persisted host_vars inventory to the GitHub repository.
```yaml
- name: Persist the facts into remote data_store which is a github repository
  hosts: rtr1
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Network acls Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.acls.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.ios.ios
      operations:
        - name: persist
      persist_empty: false
      data_store:
        scm:
          origin:
            url: "{{ your_github_repo }}"
            token: "{{ github_access_token }}"
            user:
              name: "{{ ansible_github }}"
              email: "{{ your_email@example.com }}"
```

### Display Structured Data with Gather
- The gather operation gathers the running configuration specific to acls, acl_interfaces resources
  and displays these facts in YAML formatted structures.

```yaml
- name: Display acls resources in a structured format
  hosts: rtr1
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Acls Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.acls.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.ios.ios
      operations:
        - name: gather
```

### Deploy Acls Configuration
- Deploy operation will read the facts from the provided/default or remote inventory and deploy the changes onto the appliances.

#### read host_vars from local data_store and deploy onto the field.
```yaml
- name: Deploy changes
  hosts: rtr1
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Network acls Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.acls.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.ios.ios
      operations:
        - name: deploy
      data_store:
        local: "~/backup/network"
```

#### retrieve host_cars from the Github repository and deploy changes onto the field.
```yaml
- name: retrieve config from github repo and deploy changes
  hosts: rtr1
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Network acls Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.acls.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.ios.ios
      operations:
        - name: deploy
      persist_empty: false
      data_store:
        scm:
          origin:
            url: "{{ your_github_repo }}"
            token: "{{ github_access_token }}"
            user:
              name: "{{ ansible_github }}"
              email: "{{ your_email@example.com }}"
```

### Detect configuration drift in acls Configuration
- Detect operation will read the facts from the local provided/default inventory and detect if any configuration diff exists w.r.t running-config.

#### detect the config difference between host_vars in local data_store and running-config.

```yaml
- name: Configuration drift detection
  hosts: rtr1
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Network acls Manager
    ansible.builtin.include_role:
      name: network.acls.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.ios.ios
      operations:
        - name: detect
      data_store:
        local: "~/backup/network"
```

- Detect operation will read the facts from the GitHub repository inventory and detect if any configuration diff exists w.r.t running-config.

#### detect the config difference between host_vars in local data_store and running-config.
```yaml
- name: Configuration drift detection
  hosts: rtr1
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Network acls Manager
    include_role:
      name: network.acls.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.ios.ios
      operations:
        - name: detect
      data_store:
        scm:
          origin:
            url: "{{ your_github_repo }}"
            token: "{{ github_access_token }}"
            user:
              name: "{{ ansible_github }}"
              email: "{{ your_email@example.com }}"
```

#### Remediate configuration drift in acls Configuration
The remediate operation will read the facts from the locally provided/default inventory and remediate if any configuration changes are there on the appliances using the overridden state.

```yaml
- name: Remediate configuration
  hosts: rtr1
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Network acls Manager
    include_role:
      name: network.acls.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.ios.ios
      operations:
        - name: remediate
      data_store:
        local: "~/backup/network"
```

The remediate operation will read the facts from the Github repository and remediate if any configuration changes are there on the appliances using the overridden state.

```yaml
- name: Remediate configuration
  hosts: rtr1
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Network acls Manager
    include_role:
      name: network.acls.run
    vars:
      ansible_network_os: cisco.ios.ios
      operations:
        - name: remediate
      data_store:
        scm:
          origin:
            url: "{{ your_github_repo }}"
            token: "{{ github_access_token }}"
            user:
              name: "{{ ansible_github }}"
              email: "{{ your_email@example.com }}"
```

## Testing

The project uses tox to run `ansible-lint` and `ansible-test sanity`.
Assuming this repository is checked out in the proper structure,
e.g. `collections_root/ansible_collections/network/backup`, run:

```shell
  tox -e ansible-lint
  tox -e py39-sanity
```

To run integration tests, ensure that your inventory has a `network_base` group.
Depending on what test target you are running, comment out the host(s).

```shell
[network_hosts]
ios
junos

[ios:vars]
< enter inventory details for this group >

[junos:vars]
< enter inventory details for this group >
```

```shell
  ansible-test network-integration -i /path/to/inventory --python 3.9 [target]
```
